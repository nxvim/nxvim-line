# Verify doc/bemtvi-line.txt is up to date with the Markdown it is generated
# from. Regenerates it and fails if the result differs from what is committed — so a
# push can't ship a help file that no longer matches doc/bemtvi-line.md. Wired
# as a pre-push hook via pre-commit (see .pre-commit-config.yaml); run it directly any
# time to check.
#
# The generator is deliberately reproducible (gen-vimdoc.sh strips panvimdoc's
# changing date line and normalizes smart quotes), so regenerating on a different day
# produces a byte-identical file and this check is meaningful.
#
# Requires: bash, git, pandoc (>= 3). panvimdoc is fetched into a gitignored cache on
# first run.
